# WhoIAm-frontend

## Introduction
IÂ·M is a site where users can take a nonformal personality assessment by going through a set of 50 questions ([provided by IPIP public source domain](https://ipip.ori.org/)). 

The questionnaire assesses five personality traits: Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Emotional Stability, and Intellect.

After going through the questionnaire, users will be taken to a page displaying their results. 

The results will show how they scored along the range of the personality trait along with a detailed description of what a high/low score indicates.
